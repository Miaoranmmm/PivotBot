# PivotBot: Enhancing Task Bot Engagement with Synthesized Open-Domain Dialog

This repository is for the paper [Enhancing Task Bot Engagement with Synthesized Open-Domain Dialog](https://aclanthology.org/2023.sigdial-1.46/)


In this work, we present a new automatic framework to enrich TODs with synthesized ODDs. We also introduce the PivotBot model, which is capable of handling both TOD and ODD modes and can access different knowledge sources to generate informative responses. Evaluation results indicate the superior ability of the proposed model to switch smoothly between TOD and ODD tasks.


This repository is based on hugginface transformer and ParlAI BlenderBot 1 and BlenderBot 2. Some scripts and dataset are adapted from MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset.
